# Beginner Coding Projects

## About This Repository
This repository contains beginner-friendly projects built while learning programming fundamentals.  
It represents a structured learning journey focused on writing clean code, understanding core concepts, and improving problem-solving skills through practical implementation.

## Purpose
The main goals of this repository are:

- To practice programming fundamentals  
- To build projects with proper structure and modular design  
- To improve logical thinking and flow control  
- To apply version control using Git and GitHub  
- To gradually develop a strong technical foundation  
- To prepare for a professional portfolio in the future

### CLI Calculator
- Supports basic arithmetic operations  
- Handles user input validation  
- Uses modular functions  
- Allows repeated operations  
- Developed through multiple versions (V1 → V5) with incremental improvements

### KBC Quiz Game (Kaun Banega Crorepati – CLI Version)
A command-line quiz game inspired by the popular television format.

**Features:**
- 15 structured multiple-choice questions  
- Progressive prize ladder system  
- Safe milestone levels (₹10,000 and ₹3,20,000)  
- Answer locking confirmation system  
- Quit option before answering  
- Input validation using loops  
- Clean modular workflow (separate functions for instructions, question display, answer handling, and prize logic)  
- Refactored control flow (replaced nested recursion with structured loops for better readability and stability)

This project focuses on structured program design, logical branching, loop control, and user interaction handling.
